### Accessible research software development

I love writing open source software that solves hard problems with simple interfaces and
strong documentation. With a focus on accessibility, research communities can continue
work that would otherwise stagnate.

I can help implement research software algorithms, improve research code quality,
develop data processing pipelines, design accessible data visualizations, and more!

### Training

I am passionate about learning and teaching, and in 2023 I developed a
[3-day open source geospatial workshop for researchers](https://qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher.github.io/)
and became a
[certified Carpentries instructor](/about/my-work/other-roles/carpentries-instructor.md).
I can help with, among other things:

* Git and GitHub
* Python
* Geospatial data and software development
* Unix and Linux shell
* Custom workshops

### Community engagement and inclusion

I'm an open source software developer with a passion for community engagement. I provide
a welcoming and inclusive environment for contributors of all levels to help create a
diverse and healthy community. An important part of my approach is comprehensive,
[standards-based](https://diataxis.fr/), accessible, and continuously-updated
documentation supported by
[community outreach](/about/my-work/talks/earthaccess-documentation-intro/index.md).

### Mentoring and leadership

I build two-way mutually beneficial mentoring relationships that foster growth at all
career levels and healthy team culture. My culture leadership, developer experience
leadership, and organizational development work is based on research by
[Peggy Holman](https://peggyholman.com/) and
[Dr. Cat Hicks](https://www.drcathicks.com/). I strive to build a collaborative and inclusive team
culture that values
[dialog over debate](https://b-m-institute.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/TCH_chapter.pdf).
