My main role on this project is to create an inclusive environment and improve
sustainability by recruiting a diverse team of maintainers. Much of my work has been on
Continuous Integration automations, code metadata, persistent identifiers and archival,
triaging issues, and reviewing pull requests.

Secondary to that, I occasionally fix bugs and add features :)
