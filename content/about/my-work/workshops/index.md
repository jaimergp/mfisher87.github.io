These are workshops that I developed and/or taught. Not alone, of course! Teaching in
the [Carpentries style](https://carpentries.org/workshops/) is always collaborative,
with a focus on growth, using
[mutual feedback](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/09/how-we-use-feedback/)
to stimulate continuous development.
