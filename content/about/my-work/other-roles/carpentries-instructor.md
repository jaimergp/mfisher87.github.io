## About

<!-- NOTE: This text is re-used from:

Software, Data, and Library Carpentry (The Carpentries) are programs of The
Carpentries (a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives). The
Carpentries Instructors are volunteers who teach foundational computational and
data skills to researchers, e.g., programming basics in R and Python, use of
the command line, and version control. Housed on GitHub, all Carpentriesâ€™
lessons are open source, with an open contribution model, and lessons are
collaboratively created and maintained by volunteers. Lessons are taught by
Instructors in two-day workshops.

I have volunteered as a Software Carpentry Instructor since 2023. Being a
Carpentries' Instructor has sharpened my skills in many ways. I have:

* developed my teaching abilities, both through the Instructor training course
	I attended to certify as an Instructor and through regular teaching.
* gained greater insight into and knowledge of the tools taught at workshops
* managed interpersonal interactions with a wide range of learners from all
	backgrounds
* gained useful perspectives and adaptability through teaching audiences with
	different levels of skill
* developed research and teaching insights by instructing learners in
	disciplines other than my own
* volunteered my time to help teach others computing and data skills
	because I believe in the importance of these skills to foster research
* learned better time management to stay on top of all my commitments
* deepened my understanding of and dedication to equity and inclusion
	principles through The Carpentry's ethos and Codes of Conduct.
