This post is stimulated by my employer's annual self-assessment process. It helps me to
think about the last year holistically, and write things down. My brain doesn't
naturally attach calendar timeframes to my memories
([weird memory stuff like this seems to be common for folks with autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_and_memory)),
so I hope this will help. I'm going to try and do a post like this roughly every year!

**This post covers July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024.**


## [matplotilib/viscm](https://github.com/matplotlib/viscm)

Most of this work was finished before July 1, but I'm really proud of it and it spilled
in to July, so I'm counting it! I was **not** part of the original development of viscm,
but during my work on the
[QGreenland 2023 Researcher Workshop](https://qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher.github.io/),
I wanted to use viscm to generate educational materials and found it was in a broken
state due to changes over time in the software ecosystem. The current maintainers didn't
have time to address these issues, so I fixed it up in my free time.

<!-- alex disable color -->
viscm is a tool for colormap analysis. It helps people generate colormaps that are
accessible to people with color vision impairment and analyze the accessibility of
colormaps they find in use in the wild.

I requested to join the maintainer team, and over the course of 13 pull requests in
collaboration with [Stefan van der Walt](https://github.com/stefanv) from the Matplotlib
team, I restored it to functionality, refactored, and modernized the codebase to make it
easier for future developers to build on it.


## Weird ideas

Some ideas I recorded but didn't start on ... _yet_.

* The [tine hat](https://github.com/mfisher87/tine-hat), inspired by
  [Morgan Ã…gren's Git-hat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-gVMHY8_VY).
* The [open organ](https://github.com/mfisher87/open-organ), inpired by
  [Zynthian](https://zynthian.org/)


## Organizational strategy

Throughout this year, I was an active member of NSIDC's open science working group.

I joined the newly established professional development working group, and led the
effort to update its mandate to include autonomous innovation.


## [ProjForge](https://github.com/proj-forge/proj-forge.github.io)

A free-time exploration with [Sun Bak-Hospital](https://github.com/sunny-bak) at NOAA of
writing a bespoke static site generator for generating a community-owned web user
interface to the [Proj](https://proj.org/en/9.4/) geospatial coordinate reference
system (CRS) database.

We hope that this effort could grow to also encompass community management of
corrections and additions to the Proj database, upstream of the
[EPSG organization](https://epsg.org/home.html),
which currently manages change requests to the EPSG database by private email.

We finished a prototype and deployed it to <https://proj-forge.com/>.


## [bump-my-version Conda Forge package](https://github.com/conda-forge/bump-my-version-feedstock)

In August 2023, I
[helped the author of bump-my-version package it for Conda Forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/23693)
and continue to help maintain it today.


## [conda/conda-lock](https://github.com/conda/conda-lock)

In August and September 2023, as a teaching exercise with two friends who are learning
Python,
[fixed some unintuitive behavior that can lead to breakage](https://github.com/conda/conda-lock/pull/485).
We also applied some [tooling upgrades](https://github.com/conda/conda-lock/pull/490/files).


## [QGreenland](/about/my-work/projects/qgreenland)

I was a core contributor to
[QGreenland v3](https://github.com/nsidc/qgreenland/releases/tag/v3.0.0),
released in August 2023.

In the same month, I led the creation of
[a guest post in the Jupyter Blog about our experience bringing desktop GIS software to a cloud JupyterHub environment](/about/my-work/publications/jupyter-blog-2023.md).


## [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org/), [Carpentries Instructor certification](https://carpentries.org/instructors/), & [_earthaccess_](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess)

In September (_TODO: Accurate? September is my earliest data point_) 2023, I was invited
to join the [NASA Openscapes Mentor](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/mentors.html)
team. In this role, I help researchers to adopt modern open source software development
practice and learn to work with data in the cloud, especially data too large to use in
the way they're used to, downloading it to their personal computer.

Shortly after joining the NASA Openscapes Mentor team, I took Carpentries Instructor
training and received my certification.

For the [2024 NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/champions),
[I taught a lesson on psychological safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzi-qkl8u5M)
([slides](https://github.com/mfisher87/presentation-nasa-openscapes-team-culture)) and
contributed to lessons led by other mentors.

Throughout 2023 and 2024, I have been a maintainer, core contributor, and community
manager for the [_earthaccess_](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess) project, which
simplifies both download and cloud-based access to NASA Earth Observation data from a
major hurdle to getting science done to 3 repeatable Python statements.

I co-facilitate
[bi-weekly _earthaccess_ hack day events](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/our-meet-ups/)
and have brought in several new members through outreach in other communities. My
involvement in _earthaccess_ is funded by my Openscapes salary allocation.


<!-- alex disable fellowship -->
## [Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship](https://bssw.io/pages/bssw-fellowship-program) application

In September 2023, I
[applied to the BSSw fellowship program](https://github.com/mfisher87/BSSw-fellowship-application-2024)
but was ultimately not accepted.
<!-- alex enable fellowship -->


## [Navigating the New Arctic Comnunity Office (NNA-CO)](https://nna-co.org/) webinar

In September 2023, I was an invited panelist on an NNA-CO webinar on open source
software. I
[presented briefly some of my opinions on open science and how we can adopt open science practices](https://mfisher87.github.io/presentation-20230926-nna-webinar/)
and answered questions from participants.


## Problems with credit in academia, open source mitigations

In the last quarter of 2023, I did very memorable work with a researcher that I consider
to be my most impactful work (per unit time) of the year.

<!-- alex ignore execute -->
This researcher had developed algorithms that we wanted to execute operationally at
NSIDC in partnership with the researcher. This researcher had experienced, like me, some
negative events surrounding how credit is assigned for research support work. They had
seen credit for significant work omitted or removed in final publications, and I have
had similar experiences and could relate to their skepticism about working collaboratively
from a shared repository.

However, after discussiong how
[Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) and
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) archival could enable automated creation of permanent
citable [Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)](https://www.doi.org/), we found a way
forward to working on the project together as a team while feeling safe and secure that
we would all be properly credited for our work.

**Finding comfort in shared hardships and solving problems together with this team was
extremely rewarding, and I won't forget it!**


## [NSIDC technical blog](https://nsidc.github.io/)

In May 2023, I worked with Robyn Marowitz to re-invigorate the NSIDC development team's
technical blog, contributing to three new posts.


## Hiring a new Engineering Manager for NSIDC

In late 2023 I participated on a hiring committee that successfully hired a new
Engineering Manager.


## [US Arctic Observing Network (AON) Benefit Tool](https://github.com/nsidc/usaon-benefit-tool)

The Benefit Tool enables AON administrators to configure and distribute surveys to
experts for the purpose of evaluating societal benefit of applications, data products,
and observing systems. I developed a prototype in late 2023, and continued work with
Robyn Marowitz to develop the version that's currently live.

To help smooth over the departure of our outgoing engineering manager, I took on a new
role of project manager for this project, given my established report with the client. I
facilitated development of a service agreement, negotiated requirements and deadlines,
took on new reporting duties, and additional accountability for the success of the
project.

In this project, I led the team in working openly in all regards from the start. Not
everyone had experience in working this way, but the team was excited to try. We manage
our work openly in GitHub issues and Projects, we build high quality documentation aimed
at the public, we manage our work in a way that makes it accessible to members of
the public, and we create a welcoming environment for contributors. **Our greatest measure
of success is that we been receiving ongoing volunteer contributions from an
unaffiliated member of the public over the last year, and that person has branched out
to contributing to other NSIDC projects as well.**


## My first [American Geophysical Union (AGU)](https://www.agu.org/) presentation

In December 2023, I presented a talk at AGU session
[C22: Advancing Cryospheric Research and Community Engagement Through Open-Science Tools, Data, and Collaboration](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Session/210856) -
[C22A-07: QGreenland & CryoCloud: An open GIS collaboration for education and research](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1365725).
This was my first time presenting at AGU, and the scale of the conference was
overwhelming! I often had to choose between two talks I really wanted to attend that
were occurring at the same time. It was really valuable, but intents - I wouldn't go
every year.

[My slides are available on GitHub](https://github.com/nsidc/agu2023-qgreenland-cryocloud),
but the video is not publicly available.


<!-- alex ignore white -->
## Submission to [White House Office of Science & Technology Policy Year of Open Science Recognition Challenge](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=ostp-year-of-open-science-recognition-challenge)

In December, I led a submission to the Year of Open Science Recognition Challenge. Our
team was not recognized. We are very proud of another NSIDC team,
[ELOKA, which was recognized!](https://eloka-arctic.org/news/white-house-recognizes-eloka-champion-open-science)


## Personal documentation

In late 2023, I started an effort to document my personal projects: a
[documentation website for my house](https://github.com/mfisher87/home); a
[documentation website for my home music studio](https://github.com/mfisher87/studio); a
[documentation website for my technical infrastructure](https://github.com/mfisher87/infra);
and documentation websites for my personal projects, such as my effort to build a
[daxophone](https://github.com/mfisher87/daxophone).


## [Quarto 1.4 on Conda Forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/quarto-feedstock/issues/35)

In January 2024, I helped to release [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) 1.4 on Conda Forge.
Quarto is a technical publishing tool that I use to author this website, educational
websites, slide decks, PDF documents, and more.

I'm not affiliated with the Quarto team, but I have maintained
[Quarto's Conda Forge package](https://github.com/conda-forge/quarto-feedstock) for a
year or so.

Releasing 1.4 on Conda Forge required some significant changes.
[This was a community effort](https://github.com/conda-forge/quarto-feedstock/pull/36/commits)
involving myself, other Conda Forge maintainers, and the developers of Quarto.
[Some of our packaging patches were merged into the upstream Quarto codebase](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/6730).


## [Snow Today Viewer](https://nsidc.org/snow-today/snow-viewer) enhancements

In early 2024, I started work on a project to update the Snow Today Viewer, a web
application to interactively view various near-real time snow data variables, including
snow cover percent, albedo, radiative forcing, and more, to support additional
geographic regions. It was designed with the Western US in mind, to replace a legacy
application, but I also designed it with extension in mind.

I worked with
[Sebastien Lenard of INSTAAR](https://www.colorado.edu/instaar/sebastien-lenard)
to develop new [interface specifications for sending daily near-real-time data and
metadata between an external supercomputer system and NSIDC's private cloud
infrastructure](https://snow-today-webapp-server.readthedocs.io/interfaces/).
We developed these interfaces in a way that the application could be extended to support
new regions or data variables by sending different JSON data over the interface. This
independence from the overhead of scheduling developers to make code changes and
operators to do deployments met an unrealized critical need and the system we delivered
pleasantly surprised the project's funders and managers.

In April 2024, I
[gave a presentation](https://nsidc.github.io/presentation-snow-today-2024)
to an NSIDC audience about the new functionality, architecture, and lessons learned.


## Drip irrigation

In April 2024, I hired someone to lay out some mainline and teach us how to set up drip
irrigation for our garden beds. My partner, Robin, set up drip irrigation for around 10
garden beds. This year we get to enjoy more time working with the plants and less time
watering. What a difference; the garden is no longer a chore. I wish we had done this
when I first moved in to this house!


## Review of Python educational materials for Earth scientists

In May 2024, I
[responded to a solication for review for educational materials titled "Python for Earth Scientists"](https://github.com/mstudinger/Python-Installation-for-Earth-Scientists/discussions/2).


## [QGreenland-Net](/about/my-work/projects/qgreenland-net)

From March to June 2024, I worked on a team to explore and prototype workflow
technologies we will use to build cyberinfrastructure for community-managed geospatial
research data transformation recipes which write output artifacts to
[DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/). We found many similarities between our goals and
those of [Pange Forge](https://pangeo-forge.org/), but after exploring collaboration
with members of the Pangeo Forge team, we found timing and funding considerations would
be major obstacles.

We explored several options for deployment on a pre-existing
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster at the
[Arctic Data Center (ADC)](https://arcticdata.io/), including
[Apache Beam](https://github.com/QGreenland-Net/apache-beam-exploration),
[Argo Workflows](https://github.com/QGreenland-Net/argo-exploration),
[Parsl](https://github.com/QGreenland-Net/parsl-exploration), and
[Ray](https://github.com/QGreenland-Net/ray-exploration). After in depth
exploration, we built out
[several prototypes using Argo](https://github.com/QGreenland-Net/argo-exploration/tree/3dtiles).

We applied deployability enhancements to back-end processing components within the ADC's
[Permafrost Discovery Gateway](https://github.com/PermafrostDiscoveryGateway), including
dockerization and Conda Forge packaging.

I [found and fixed a bug in Argo's docs](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/13047).


## A way to automate inclusive language checking

In May 2024, I set up a
[ pre-commit "mirror" repository for Alex.js](https://github.com/mfisher87/alexjs-pre-commit-mirror).
This enables [Alex.js](https://alexjs.com/), an inclusive language checker, to be run with
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), an automation tool for Git, by copying a few
lines of configuration, no extra installation required.


## [NASA ROSES proposal to fund _earthaccess_ sustainment](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess-proposal-2024-nasa-roses)

In May and June 2024, I co-authored a proposal under the
[NASA ROSES 2024: F.7 Support for Open-Source Tools, Frameworks, and Libraries](https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/352756)
solicitation to fund continued development of the
[_earthaccess_](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess) project.


## [Arctic Rain on Snow Study stations & events database](https://github.com/nsidc/aross-stations)

In a couple of days in June 2024, I built out a PostGIS database, software to load it
with rain on snow events recorded by Automated Surface Observation Stations (ASOS),
software to query the database through an HTTP API powered by
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and documentation fully-tested by a real user.

The database tables are modeled with [SQLAlchemy 2](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) &
[GeoAlchemy2](https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.io/); other data models are managed with
[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/).

We will soon build a UI for searching and visualizing these rain on snow events and make
the API and UI available to the public.


## [NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/)

Reviewer and subject matter expert (SME) for 2024 Space Apps Challenge number 19.


## Open communities & team/organizational culture development

In pursuit of a new passion for team culture, in late 2023 I started reading voraciously
about the subject. I started Peggy Holman's books _Engaging Emergence_ and _The Change
Handbook_, in addition to research papers by Holman, Julie Lowndes (a colleague through
the [NASA-Openscapes Mentor program](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/)), and Cat Hicks.

In December 2023, I attended the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community
Management (CSCCE)
[Enacting culture change: The Four-Frame Model workshop](https://web.archive.org/web/20231207080346/https://www.cscce.org/event/mini-workshop-enacting-culture-change-the-four-frame-model/).

I established discussion groups in my work communities: the
[Openscapes psychological safety seaside chat](https://openscapes.github.io/seaside-chat-psychological-safety/)
with Sun Bak- Hospital in April 2024; and the
[NSIDC open science reading club](https://nsidc.github.io/open-science-reading-club/)
with Robyn Marowitz in Feb & May 2024. In April 2024, I attended a presentation
and small group follow-up discussion about implicit bias in the workplace, both led by
[CIRES](https://cires.colorado.edu/) DEI Director Becca Edwards. In June 2024 I also
joined a CIRES neurodiversity bookclub led by Becca Edwards in which we will read
_Neurodiversity at Work: Drive Innovation, Performance and Productivity with a
Neurodiverse Workforce_.


## Reflection
