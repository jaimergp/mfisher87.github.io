# TODO

- [ ] Open issue for Quarto listing sort by date putting undefined first
- [ ] Make breadcrumbs work on project pages, or report issue.
    - Add the pages to sidebar as "contents" but hide the entries from the actual
      sidebar with some depth setting?
- [ ] Put re-usable text in a dedicated file, e.g.:
    - [ ] `professional-short-summary.md`
    - [ ] `skills-list.md`
- [ ] Add accommodations page
- [ ] Add "my favorite community interactions" page. How to organize the data in a
      lightweight way?


## Resume

- [ ] Build a version that works on web and PDF from the same source.
- [ ] Rebuild as multi-page format
    - [ ] Break NASA Openscapes Mentor role to its own top-level experience section.
- [ ] Replace broken 2022 OPA link


## About page

- [ ] Build a narrative based on
      [Telling your own stories in career transitions](https://www.drcathicks.com/post/telling-your-own-stories-in-career-transitions)
- [ ] Add more example links to `about/index.md`, specifically this part:
    > I can help implement research software algorithms, improve research code quality,
    > develop data processing pipelines, design accessible data visualizations, and
    > more!
- [ ] Re-consider the "features" text and buttons.


## Details about interests

I used to have (a superset of) this text on the home page. It's less detailed now. Add
some page that expounds on the interests list?

* Open Science and open-source software; teaching scientists how to use Git
* Data visualization quality (e.g. appropriate and accessible colormaps)
* Software documentation quality
* Infrastructure and operations as code
* Music
* DIY electronics and repair


## Details about skills

Right now, there's no place for this, just for experience. "Skills" doesn't fit very
well in "My work", so is there another way we can rename that category so it does fit?


## My work

### Maintenance page

* Earthaccess: maintenance and/or core contributor?


## ORCiD page updates

Consider whether each of these repos also needs Zenodo integration.
