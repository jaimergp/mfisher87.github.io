title: "Learning objectives"
---

In the following subjects, I want to transition from "have never used/practiced" to
"active learner".

I only have so much time in my life to learn these things, so I should be looking for
ways to _effectively_ integrate these technologies or concepts in to my other projects.

If you are interested in a mentoring, teaching, or learning relationship with me
(preferably bi-directional), I would love to hear from you!


## :sparkles: Have never used/practiced

- [ ] [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
    - I feel this will help me write more usable user interfaces faster and with
      significantly less maintenance burden.
- [ ] [Nix/NixOS](https://nixos.org/)
    - I feel this will help me build reproducible computing environments, and could
      revolutionize the way I interact with computers day-to-day.
- [ ] [Development containers](https://containers.dev/)
    - I feel this will help me share development environment configuration that will
      improve accessibility for contributors to my open source projects.
    - Perhaps Nix skills are a good substitute/overlap.
- [ ] Musical chord progressions
    - I feel this will help me become a better improvisor and writer. My current
      understanding of chord progressions is very trial-and-error, so I would consider
      myself "started" once I've begun learning in a systematic, instead of ad-hoc, way.
- [ ] Open hardware
    - I have several ideas for open hardware projects, for example an open source stage
      keyboard powered by a single-board computer, or an electromagnetic hi-hat. I don't
      know where to start!


### Low priority, but still exciting!

- [ ] [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
    - I'd really like to be strong with at least one low-level language, but it's hard
      to find opportunities to learn Rust. As more Python tooling is being written in
      Rust (Ruff, Polars, ...), perhaps more opportunities will present themselves.
- [ ] [CLever Audio Plug-in (CLAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLever_Audio_Plug-in) development
    - I have several ideas for audio / MIDI processing software, but don't know where to
      start.


## :student: Successfully started learning!

- [x] Organizational development
    - I feel this will help me be an effective advocate for change, especially in
      inclusiveness and openness.
    - Reading [_Engaging Emergence_](https://peggyholman.com/papers/engaging-emergence/)
      by [Peggy Holman](https://peggyholman.com/)
- [x] Pedagogy / Andragogy
    - I feel this will help me become a more effective teacher and learner, and
      therefore more able to support and lead researchers in transitioning to open
      science work modalities.
    - I become a
      [Certified Carpentries Instructor](/my-work/other-roles/carpentries-instructor.html)
      in 2023.
    - I co-developed and administrated the
      [QGreenland 2023 Researcher Workshop](/my-work/projects/qgreenland-workshops/) in 2023.
